__Introduction to Data Structures__
Overview of data structures and their importance in computer science.
Basic terminology: elements, data types, operations.
Types of data structures: linear (arrays, linked lists) and nonlinear (trees, graphs).

__Arrays__
Definition and properties of arrays.
Operations: accessing, inserting, deleting elements.
Multi-dimensional arrays and their applications.
Time and space complexity analysis.

__Linked Lists__
Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
Implementation of basic operations: insertion, deletion, traversal.
Comparison with arrays and their advantages/disadvantages.
Applications in practice.

__Stacks and Queues__
Introduction to stacks and queues: definitions, characteristics.
Implementations using arrays and linked lists.
Basic operations: push, pop (for stacks); enqueue, dequeue (for queues).
Applications: expression evaluation, reversing strings, etc.

__Trees__
Introduction to trees: terminology, definitions.
Binary trees, binary search trees (BST).
Traversal algorithms: in-order, pre-order, post-order.
Operations: insertion, deletion, searching.
Balanced trees: AVL trees, red-black trees.

__Graphs__
Basics of graph theory: definitions, types of graphs.
Representation of graphs: adjacency matrix, adjacency list.
Graph traversal algorithms: depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS).
Applications: shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford), minimum spanning tree (Prim's, Kruskal's).

__Sorting and Searching Algorithms__
Overview of sorting algorithms: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort.
Comparison of sorting algorithms based on time and space complexity.
Overview of searching algorithms: linear search, binary search.

__Advanced Data Structures__
Hash tables and hash functions.
Heaps and priority queues.
Trie data structure.
Disjoint-set data structure (Union-Find).

__Additional Resources__
Links to additional readings, online courses, and tutorials for further exploration.
